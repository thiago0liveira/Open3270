* Support for formatted and unformatted screens 
* Support for multiple LUs and connections that require a specific LU to be specified 
* Support for unlimited TN3270 connections from a single application 
* Support for ASP.NET and WinForms applications
* 100% Managed Microsoft .NET 3270 emulation
* Support for multiple LUs, formatted and unformatted screens and most 3270 "bugs".
